# MyOS

## Project Description
The main objective is to create an OS from the ground up using Assembly Language (x86), followed by some C coding. Independent project to master git usage, low-level programming and overall computer software/hardware concepts.

### How the Archive Works
I will be using an Archive to compartmentalize my thoughts. For each time some big change or implementation is completed, I will create a new README in the archive.
